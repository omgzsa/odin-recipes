    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Make your own sushi! Making sushi at home is surprisingly simple. We'll
      start with how to make sushi for beginners, which means sushi rolls. With
      just a little practice, you can make sushi rolls at home that are as
      dazzling to look at as they are delicious to eat.

      You can't use just any rice for sushi. Sushi rice is a special preparation
      of rice flavored with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. It's made from
      short-grain rice (Japonica), typically made in Japan and parts of
      California and Italy.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sushi rice</li>
      <li>Avocado</li>
      <li>Soy sauce</li>
      <li>Nori leafs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the bamboo rolling mat (you can get one for as little as $7 on
        Amazon) on a cutting board so the bamboo strips are running horizontally
        to you. Spread a strip of plastic wrap over the bamboo mat. Then place a
        sheet (or a half sheet) of nori on the plastic wrap.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori. Don't use too much
        rice. With a little practice, you'll get a feel for how much rice to
        use. We're spreading about 1 cup of rice per whole sheet of nori,
        leaving a small space at the top edge of the nori so you can seal up the
        roll.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add your ingredients toward the center of the rice-covered nori. Don't
        overpack it. If you're making a roll with the rice on the outside,
        simply turn the nori over, placing it rice-side down on the rolling mat.
      </li>
    </ol>
